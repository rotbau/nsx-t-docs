# nsx-t-docs

This is a repository where I'm storing my methods and order of installation for NSX-T (2.3.1).  This documentation loosely follows the offical VMware documentation.

Follow at your own risk - I make no guarantees of correct or complete steps,  I would recommend you follow the official VMware documents but feel free to browse and use whatever is helpful.
